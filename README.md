### Project idea

I got the idea of this app by trying to find one really easy to use budget management app on the PlayStore, the conclusion was simple: There was no app on the PlayStore that fitted my needs.

I wanted a simpler app to manage budget on Android: No stats/graph, simple interface, quick and efficient. so I simply decided to create it in my free time, with the hope that I'm not the only one looking for an easiest way to manage my budget.
